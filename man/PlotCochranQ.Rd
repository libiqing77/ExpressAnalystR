\description{
Plot Q-Q plot for estimating statistical heterogeneity. Cochranâ€™s Q test is calculated as the weighted sum of squared differences between individual study effects and the pooled effect across studies. When the estimated Q values have approximately a chi-squared distribution, it suggests FEM assumption is appropriate. If it deviates significantly from a chi-squared distribution, REM should usually be used.
